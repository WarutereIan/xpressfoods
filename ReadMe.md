## Development Build Setup

Follow these steps to run the build in development mode:

1. **Install dependencies**

   Run the following command in your project directory:

   `npm install`

2. **Start Expo server**

Launch the Expo development server:

    `npm start`

This command will generate a QR code in your terminal.

3. **Install Expo Go on your mobile device**

Download and install the Expo Go app from your device's app store:

- [Expo Go for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
- [Expo Go for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

4. **Scan the QR code**

Open Expo Go on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed in your terminal (from step 2).

5. **Launch the app**

After scanning the QR code, Expo Go will launch the app in its development build on your phone.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or running the app, please check the following:

- Ensure your mobile device and development machine are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- If the app doesn't load, try closing and reopening Expo Go.
- Check that all dependencies are correctly installed by running `npm install` again.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).
